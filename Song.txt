Heavy in you arms 
Its hard to carry me
My beloved was weighed down
My finger laced to crown

I was a heavy heart to carry
My feet dragged across the ground
And he took me to the river
Where he slowly let me drown
I'm Shaboz

My love has concrete feet
My love's an iron ball
Wrapped around your ankles
Over the waterfall
